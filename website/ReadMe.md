# BMIER Website roadmap

1. Choose a web development framework or library: There are many different frameworks and libraries available for building web applications and websites, such as Django, Flask, or React. Choose one that fits your needs and goals, and familiarize yourself with its documentation and tutorials.

2. Set up a local development environment: You will need a local development environment where you can work on your web page and test it before deploying it to a live server. This typically involves installing a web server (such as Apache or Nginx), a database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL), and any necessary dependencies and libraries.

3. Design and structure your web page: Decide on the layout, content, and overall look and feel of your web page. You may want to use a tool like Adobe XD or Figma to create a design mockup or prototype.

4. Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to structure and content of your web page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control the appearance and layout, and JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior.

5. Test and debug your web page: Test your web page on different devices and browsers to ensure that it looks and works as expected. Use the developer tools in your web browser to identify and fix any issues or bugs.

6. Deploy your web page: Once you are satisfied with your web page, you can deploy it to a live server so that it can be accessed by users on the internet. You will need to choose a hosting provider and follow their instructions for uploading and publishing your web page.
